I didn't really understand the payout situation even after reading carefully.,"I first looked at the chance and if it was 90% white 10% black, I probably didn't buy protection or 50 cents at most. Then, I looked at the gremlin and if they were only honest ones I was willing to pay up to $2. If there were white/black gremlins and there was a high chance of black balls I figured I would pay up to $1 just incase. ",I looked at the percentage of black balls and then looked at how many honest vs. black vs. white gremlins there were. If there were honest ones the probability was 100$. If there were white gremlins and honest gremlins and it asked about the probability of a black ball I would say 100% because the white gremlins can't choose black balls (and vice versa).,Maybe having a feature where the instructions are read out loud (through headphones).

I got a lot of honest gremlins so anytime i had a white or black one because i never had both in on grouping it was normally 2 honest or like 4 honest and 1 black or white gremlin so then i would go off of the answer that was opposite of what the white or black gremlin was cause how could it tell me if the answer was a color it couldn't see.,"i calculated the % of correctness in relation to the number of gremlins i got and which types they were but then i realized i think i miss calculated on the second question and put 90% instead of 60% ","For the pricing question instead of the participants picking the pricing I would state how much the hint costs and then see how many participants would be willing to pay for the hit given the odds. Because my answers i think were all in the 1 or .50 range because i got the hint either way if I bought it (idk why i valued some at 1 or .50) ",The comprehension questions made me feel not smart because I only got .20 (I think) I don't really know how many of the other study questions I got right.,1,76,4,3,1,1,4.00,,,30,5,20,0,24,"1 1 10 1 0,2 1 30 0 0,3 1 30 0 0,4 1 10 1 0,5 1 30 0 0,6 1 30 0 0,7 2 30 0 0 0,8 2 30 0 0 0,9 2 30 0 0 0,10 2 30 0 0 0,11 2 30 0 0 0,12 2 30 0 0 0,13 3 30 1 1 100 0.10933568018811923 Lottery,14 3 30 0 0 0 0.6409169669169885 Event,15 3 30 0 0 20 0.9569835831999023 Event,16 3 30 1 1 100 0.47557994370253076 Lottery,17 3 10 1 1 60 0.9029245838028519 Event,18 3 10 1 1 80 0.4846424894799175 Lottery,19 4 0 1,20 4 0 1,21 4 0 1,22 4 0 1,23 4 0 1,24 4 0 1,",,4,0,1,,,2,-1,"0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 2_1_0, 0.1, 1_1_1, 0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 2_1_0, 0.3, 1_1_1|0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 2_0_1, 0.1, 4_1_0, 0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 2_0_1, 0.3, 4_1_0|0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 4_0_1, 0.1, 3_1_1, 0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 4_0_1, 0.3, 3_1_1|0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 2_1_0, 0.2, 1_1_1, 0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 2_1_0, 0.5, 1_1_1|0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 2_0_1, 0.2, 4_1_0, 0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 2_0_1, 0.5, 4_1_0|0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 4_0_1, 0.2, 3_1_1, 0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 4_0_1, 0.5, 3_1_1|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 5_2_0, 0.3, 5_0_2, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 5_2_0, 0.1, 5_0_2|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 5_1_1, 0.3, 5_2_0, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 5_1_1, 0.1, 5_2_0|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 5_1_1, 0.3, 5_0_2, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 5_1_1, 0.1, 5_0_2|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 1_1_0, 0.3, 1_0_1, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 1_1_0, 0.1, 1_0_1|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 1_0_1, 0.3, 1_1_0, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 1_0_1, 0.1, 1_1_0|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 2_1_0, 0.3, 1_1_1, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 2_1_0, 0.1, 1_1_1|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 2_0_1, 0.3, 4_1_0, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 2_0_1, 0.1, 4_1_0|0.3, 2_0_0, 0.3, 4_0_1, 0.3, 3_1_1, 0.1, 2_0_0, 0.1, 4_0_1, 0.1, 3_1_1|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 5_2_0, 0.5, 5_0_2, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 5_2_0, 0.2, 5_0_2|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 5_1_1, 0.5, 5_2_0, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 5_1_1, 0.2, 5_2_0|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 5_1_1, 0.5, 5_0_2, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 5_1_1, 0.2, 5_0_2|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 1_1_0, 0.5, 1_0_1, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 1_1_0, 0.2, 1_0_1|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 1_0_1, 0.5, 1_1_0, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 1_0_1, 0.2, 1_1_0|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 2_1_0, 0.5, 1_1_1, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 2_1_0, 0.2, 1_1_1|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 2_0_1, 0.5, 4_1_0, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 2_0_1, 0.2, 4_1_0|0.5, 2_0_0, 0.5, 4_0_1, 0.5, 3_1_1, 0.2, 2_0_0, 0.2, 4_0_1, 0.2, 3_1_1",,,,,,21,30.2,Q350,0.2,1,30,12,1.0,1.0,0,

","Similar to the same strategy in task 2 - if a color was pulled a gremlin cannot say BUT a gremlin said it and theres only honest gremlins i was highly confident that it was correct. ","I think the instructions on the last 2 tasks were a bit confusing, I think it would have been nice to do a practice demo and see how the guesses would affect payment if that didn't effect the study. Or even watching a short demo, I was just mainly confused on how my guess affected my payment.

I was confused about the money aspect of it, but I figured it out after the round was over. I would've protected more of the rounds in that task has I understood.

","I looked at the probability of the balls colors as well as the types of things giving the hints. I would protect if there was a high chance of the ball being a certain color and if the hint could be false. ","If the thing was honest I would do 100% because they do not lie. I knew that for both the white and the black monsters (I forgot what they were called) they both say their specific color, but they wouldn't ever say the color that they weren't. Because of this, I knew the probability was high/100% that the ball would be white if the set up of monsters were honest and black ones because the black ones can not say that the ball is white.

I would take the hint because in my opinion 25 dollars is better than 10, or the risk of winning 30. I am a bit of a gambling man, but when the white and black eyed gremlins could have been lying about something they said I figured better to take the confirmed money than risk it for more. ","The strategy I used in the measuring chances was a bit similar to the previous one. I figured it was better to leave with 25 dollars than risk the 5 and potentially leave with 10 dollars.
