This made it easier to calculate the probability of what the chances the gremlins would give regardless of the actual odds (14/6 white-black balls)","Again, this one also I used the odds of the gremlins and calculated the chance as close as possible. I did not include the chance of the actual balls, but left it to the chance that the gremlins were telling the truth.","Change the prompt up for the instructions on the 4th set, as they are confusing as they read right now.","I thought this experiment was interesting and useful for calculating risk/reward. If you haven't studied or read up on the Monty Hall problem, I would recommend it as I see it being applicable here in some capacity.

I felt like i was guessing more than making an informed decision.

","I also looked at how many honest gremlins there were. I did not pay as much attention to the percentage of white or black balls in the mix. If there were white or black eyed gremlins, i was more likely to give a smaller percentage","Instructions could possibly be improved. The explanation of payment for round 3 could be improved. Instead of writing examples, there could be practice rounds after the instructions. That way, I make a decision based on gremlins, balls, etc and see how my decision affects my payout.

For example, if they were all honest then I would not buy protection if they said white but would if they said black. Furthermore, if four were honest and one was a white-choosing gremlin, then if the gremlins said the ball was black I would buy protection; Considering that the white gremlin could only say the ball would be white, then it is known that an honest gremlin said that the ball would be black and vise versa.

If there was a 1/3 chance of an honest gremlin being picked for the hint I would just buy protection because I did not like the odds of the hint being true. If the chance of an honest gremlin being picked was 2/3 I would look at the probability of a white/black ball being chosen and then make my decision to protect or not off of that.,If the gremlins were all honest I would choose 100%. If there was no honest gremlins I would select whatever the actual probability of selecting one of the balls was. If there was one honest gremlin I would just go a little above what the actual percent of a black/white ball being picked.,Not that I can think of.,I enjoyed it.,2,73,4,2,30,5,20,0,24,"1 1 30 0 0,2 1 30 0 0,3 1 30 0 0,4 1 10 1 0,5 1 30 0 0,6 1 25 0 1,7 2 30 0 0 0,8 2 30 0 0 0,9 2 25 0 0 1,10 2 30 0 0 0,11 2 30 0 0 0,12 2 25 0 1 1,13 3 30 0 0 0 0.7567907459190324 Event,14 3 30 0 1 36 0.28872345672748323 Lottery,15 3 10 0 0 29 0.2657437887700209 Lottery,16 3 30 0 0 0 0.0441564361363036 Event,17 3 30 0 0 0 0.8294654045983352 Event,18 3 30 0 0 30 0.41275508248768 Event,19 4 4 2,20 4 0 1,21 4 0 1,22 4 5 2,23 4 0 1,24 4 0 1,",,4,0,1,,,4,-1,"0.1,2_0_0,0.1,2_0_1,0.1,1_1_1,0.3,2_0_0,0.3,2_0_1,0.3,1_1_1;0.1,2_0_0,0.1,2_1_0,0.1,4_0_1,0.3,2_0_0,0.3,2_1_0,0.3,4_0_1;0.1,2_0_0,0.1,4_1_0,0.1,3_1_1,0.3,2_0_0,0.3,4_1_0,0.3,3_1_1;0.2,2_0_0,0.2,2_0_1,0.2,1_1_1,0.5,2_0_0,0.5,2_0_1,0.5,1_1_1;0.2,2_0_0,0.2,2_1_0,0.2,4_0_1,0.5,2_0_0,0.5,2_1_0,0.5,4_0_1;0.2,2_0_0,0.2,4_1_0,0.2,3_1_1,0.5,2_0_0,0.5,4_1_0,0.5,3_1_1",,,,,1,10,T101,
