Which task did you find the most confusing?
I think all of them made sense
The last task was slightly the most confusing
The third and fourth. Third because even though I remember about multiplying probabilities, a) I wasn't sure if this was the right procedure though I thought so, b) it was confusing for me to determine the right probability based on truth vs lie...like if there was a 2/3 chance it was correct info and 1/3 incorrect, I wasn't sure which of these two fractions to use to multiply by the other number and c) when there were 3 gremlins, one honest and two dishonest, I just assumed there was a 50/50 chance the info was correct, but this doesn't seem quite right from what I remember from high school math....   
They were all pretty simple, the instructions were sometimes a bit confusing but easier to understand once in the round. 
Task 4
Measuring Chances
trying to read the instructions and organize the information in my mind when the gremlins came into the mix along with comprehending the instructions for the last round. I understood in the end but it took me a bit to comprehend the words I was reading. 
Task four's instructions were the most confusing.
The last part was the only confusing part.
The final task
The buying of protection mixed with the buying of gremlins for hint. 
**************************************************
 

Please explain the strategy you used for Task 2 (Informed Protection)? This is the task in which you see a hint and then decide to protect or not.
I only trusted the hint if the majority of gremlins were honest
If it was an honest gremlin, I always trusted it. If it was not, it depended on the proportion of white & black balls, plus the gremlin composition to make my decisions. Generally, if 2 or more of the gremlins were not honest, and 3 or more of the balls were black, I bought protection.
If there seems to be a greater than 50% that the information is correct, it seems worth protecting (if applicable) 
I just thought about the probabilities of black/white ball and choose accordingly. 
The number of a certain type of gremlin present
If the gremlins were all honest, then I didn't need protection--otherwise, I did.
If all were honest, no protection. If there was a black gremlin but they said it was white, no protection. If there was a white gremlin but said it was black, no protection. All other scenarios I bought protection. 
In task 2 I chose to buy protection if the majority of the gremlins were not honest. If the majority of the gremlins were honest and the balls were mostly white then I did not buy protection. 
If it was honest I always did it.  If it was split with a white or black, I did it still.  But if there were 2 or more white or black, I didn't.
I got confused and did not have one for task 2-4
Depending on the type of gremlin, I decided. Chances of a white swamp gremlin would be 20% of 4 others were honest gremlins. 
**************************************************
 

Please explain the strategy you used in Task 3 (Measuring Chances)? This is the task in which you use sliders.
Same as above, when majority were honest it was a high perecntage but if majority were wrong gremlins it was a low percentage
It was very similar to what I did in task 3, just using a general confidence scale with my strategy
Multiplying probabilities, as mentioned above...but unsure if i was doing it correctly
I took the percentage that the hint would be "true" and the percentage of the ball being black or white and guesstimated. 
Estimating probability
I did my best to calculate the true statistical probability of the outcome in question.
Same thoughts as I mentioned above. If it was complicated I sort of just guessed how much of a percent to choose. 
I tried to do some math in my head at first, but I wasn't really sure if I was doing it right. At the end I started just going with the percentage of the balls that were given.
Basically if it had any black or white gremlins I dropped it to 50%.  If it was honest I was 100%.  Or if the gemlins talking didn't match the gemlin (white saying the ball is black, etc.) I went 100%.

Comparison of the composition of gremlins and the number of balls.

Do you see any ways to improve the experiment?
NO
The instructions on the last task could be slightly less confusing. I understood, but it didn't seem to be as complex as the instructions worded it.
The instructions on sections 3 and 4 were a little confusing, because read a certain way, it seemed that if I overshot the percentage I had more of a chance of losing money than undershooting it.
I'm not sure 
No
A minor note: Unless I calculated wrong (which is, of course, possible), one of the statistical probabilities in the Measuring Chances task was 7.5%, which is what I wanted to indicate; but only integers were accepted (so I rounded up to 8). Perhaps allowing decimal points would be helpful.
With the concept, I don't see a need for improvements. It was hard for me to focus on reading the instructions because my eyes began to hurt from looking at the screen but I don't think that was your fault. 
The instructions on section four could have been a little more clear.
The last task needed more explanation

An interactive example would help.

Anything else you would like to say about the experiment?
I liked the gremlins
Super fun!

None that I can think of

No--thank you!
This was cute!

no. thank you.
