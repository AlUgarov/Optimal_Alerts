5,"""if the hint was favorable not protection and vice versa""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I always bought protection unless I was certain that I didn't need it (i.e. both gremlins were honest or it wasn't possible to get the black/white gremlin)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I trusted honest golems fully, and did not put much stock in the swamp golems.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""my strategy was to just look at what the odds were""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"""I looked at the percentages of white and black balls and made my guess off of that. Also, there was no big harm in buying protection, and there was a lot of harm if you did not buy protection and got a black ball. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"""I trusted my instinct.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If the entire panel of gremlins was honest and they told me that the selection was white, I did not buy protection, since I could be certain that I would not lose money.  In any other scenario, I bought protection.  In my case, better to guarantee a $25 return every time than risk $20 for a $5 reward.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""if it is an honest one, i don't need to buy informed protection cuz i can't trust its hint.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I think the gremlins were confusing, but if you see how many gremlins were. Then from that how many of each type where and what they say, after that you based that to the actual percentage of balls you get close to the answer.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""I am a little bit more risky so I chose to not get protection if any of the monsters said it was white because I felt the probability of one of the honest ones getting picked was higher and if they said it was black I bough protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""i used probablity and if the odds were more in favor i would mae a decision based on that and the ball probabilty color""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If the hint was from one of the honest gremlins then I didn't choose to protect because they could only tell the truth. If there were any just black or just white gremlins then I decided to protect because the information they give isn't helpful """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""See the quantity of hints and the percentage of drawing the colors of the balls. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I would calculate the probability that the gremlins were right. So in task two, I already did task 3. Like if there were two black/white gremlins, I would add the probability that they were right to the certainly that the honest gremlin was right.  """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I would see what the probability that they are telling the truth is and then see if they were saying black. if no one was the black swamp monster then I knew it was black and therefore it would be 100%""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I looked at the box of balls and the box of gremlins.  If the gremlins were honest or white, I would not use protection for a white ball. If the ball was black I would sometimes take my chances depending on the amount of white and black balls.  If they were honest or black, I would use protection for a black ball. If the ball was white, I would not use protection since there were mostly honest gremlins.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I weighed the cost of loosing money and percentage difference with that chances of getting a white ball.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I weighed my odds. I knew they were in my favor.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""When I paid attention to the composition of the box and saw the gremlins, that helped to inform my decision on whether to buy protection. For example, if I saw the box had equal numbers of both black and white ball and two honest gremlins were there, I did not buy protection. When I saw a box with a larger amount of black than white balls and had a white-swamp gremlin with four honest gremlins, I opted to buy protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"""I would the probability of one of the balls being picked. If the chances were not likely than I would not protect it. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I looked at what percentage of gremlins were honest and used that info in my decisions.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"""Instinct and possibility of either white or black being picked""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I took protection when there was a higher chance of drawing out black balls.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""If all glimpses are honest, then choose not to protect on each color. If most are honest and one is black, then choose not to protect white color. If the one is white, then choose not to protect black because we know white one always say white, so black color should be the truth.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I based my decision on the probability  of the honest gremlin being chosen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I would base my answers off of how many honest goblins there were.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I chose the best odds""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""If it was more than approximately a 70% chance of drawing a black ball, I decided to protect. The cost to protect outweighed the potential loss of not protecting. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If the gremlin was honest then I did not buy protection because they were accurate in telling me the color of the ball.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If there were only honest gremlins then I never protected but even if there was one white-swamp gremlin or one black-swamp gremlin then I payed for protection. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If the gremlins were honest, I didn't buy protection. If there were swap gremlins, I calculated the chance of getting a hint from a swap gremlin and considered that along with the chance of getting a black ball. If the total chance of getting a black ball was more than 15% I get protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I determined what the probability was that the gremlin would tell the truth. The more honest gremlins in the lineup, the less likely I was to buy protection. However, I'm risk-averse, so I was more likely to buy protection than not because the risk was too high and the cost of protection was low.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I just used probability in my head""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I took into consideration how many honest there were and looked at the chances of picking a ball """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I was able to calculate the odds from the hints. It was not a measurement requiring me to calculate the chance of balls, but of variance between the hints. This made it easier to calculate the probability of what the chances the gremlins would give regardless of the actual odds (14/6 white-black balls)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I just took into note the goblins that were listed, and then the probability of which the information could be truthful or not.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I just relied on the number of honest gremlins to inform my decisions""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""If there were a white swamped gremlin, I would buy the protection if it said white ball. If it said black on a white swamped I would always not buy the protection. This is vice versa if there was a black swamped gremlin.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I used the strategy of using the ""honest gremlin"" to my advantage to know when I could get away with not paying for protection""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""I relied on understanding which type of gremlin was presented and then based my decision on their bias/lack of bias. Honest gremlin were a simple binary decision (white -> no protection, black -> protection). The white gremlin would default to no protection unless the probability of black was greater than 25%. The black gremlin defaulted to protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I considered the probability of the computer selecting a white ball and a honest gremlin. If that probability was high (>70%), then I decided not to buy protection. When there were only honest and black gremlins and the hint was that the ball was white, then it was easier since that hint could only come from an honest gremlin.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I took into consideration which of the gremlins I got. If it were two honest ones, I would not buy protection if they said white because they were right. If they were two honest ones and a black one, and they said it was white, I would do the same thing because the black one would never say the ball is white. If any of the gremlins said the ball was black, I would buy protection because there would always be a chance that the ball was black.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""It was really just similar to math and common sense.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I went with the odds. I didn't buy protection if the probability of picking a ball was really high in a situation""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I would look at how many honest gremlins there were to see if i could trust it or not. ex: if there were only honest and white gremlins, and they said the ball was white, i would trust that. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If it was all honest then I 100% percent trusted it and went for no protection but if there was even a chance of dishonest gremlin then I went with protection""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""My strategy depended on the gremlins. I was willing to pay a higher price for more honest gremlins, while I was not willing to pay as much when there were not as many honest gremlins.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"""The higher the % of black balls the more likely I was to buy protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I based it off of the amount of different colored balls mainly. Because, if there was only 2 black balls and one black gremlin, then I would most likely have a white ball chose if the other two were honest. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I looked at the percentage and the chance of drawing which ball, and I compared it to the grimlin options/hints and made my decision based off of the numbers I was provided.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I am broke and I was willing to take risks to make more money.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I just hoped for the best and picked one""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If it was all honest gremlins I did not buy protection. Even if there was one un honest gremlin I was skeptical to buy protection. If there was more than one un honest gremlin I definitely bought protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"""If there were more black balls I would decide to protect it because there was a higher chance it needed to be and if there were more white balls I didn't protect it because I assumed the chance of a black ball being chosen was lower.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""My strategy in task two was primarily based on the gremlins. For example, if they were all honest then I would not buy protection if they said white but would if they said black. Furthermore, if four were honest and one was a white-choosing gremlin, then if the gremlins said the ball was black I would buy protection; Considering that the white gremlin could only say the ball would be white, then it is known that an honest gremlin said that the ball would be black and vise versa.",I did not really consider the probability,of,the,balls,being,chosen,and,rather,focused,on,the,likely,hood,that,the,hint,given,by,the,gremlins,is,correct.,""""
3,"""I would first take into account how many white and how many black balls were in a box, and the chance of drawing each. With the gremlins then telling a hint I would not buy protection if the gremlin said white and the percent of drawing white was more than 75%. I used this kind of method for the whole task.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""my strategy for this task was to only buy protection if there was a white or black gremlin and not if there was a truth gremlin """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,"""I took my chances that the gremlins telling the truth would be selected""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If the goblins were all honest I would buy protection if they say the black was the ball chosen and not if the ball was white. If 1 of the goblins was saying the ball was black or white exclusively I would buy protection if they say it was black and not if the ball was white. If 2 of the goblins was saying the ball was black or white exclusively I would buy protection no matter what they said""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""How likely it was that it would be white """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I mainly looked at the probability percentage of the computer choosing a white ball. If it was greater than or equal to 70%, then I would not choose protection.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""It was pretty simple, actually. I basically based my decision off of the amount of honest gremlins there were. If there were 4/5 honest, then there was an 80% chance the hint was correct. On a situation with 50% white and 50% black, this strategy proved to be helpful.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I based my decision off of the makeup of the gremlins if they were all honest and said the ball was white I would not buy protection and if they said it was black I would buy protection. If there was a 1/3 chance of an honest gremlin being picked for the hint I would just buy protection because I did not like the odds of the hint being true. If the chance of an honest gremlin being picked was 2/3 I would look at the probability of a white/black ball being chosen and then make my","decision to protect or not off of that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I based my chances solely on the honest Gremlins.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I mostly would buy protection if there was an over 50 percent chance to get a black ball. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""I thought of how many un honest gremlins there were and tried to guess the percent of accuracy I would be given based on the colors. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""If it was mostly Honest Grimlins I took the hint""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I looked at the different types of gremlins in each group to make my decision. If it was all of the honest gremlins, I would go from there, but even if it were 2 honest and 1 black or white swamp gremlin that would inform my decision better than if it was an equal mix of all three types""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I looked at the % of white vs black balls then looked at how many honest grimlins there were. If there were a majority of white balls and honest grimlins I would do no protection for a white ball but buy protection for black.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""Always went with the honest ones. When there was one white or one black, I would know it was an honest one when they said the opposite of the color. For example, two honest and one white, when it said the ball was black, I knew it would be black because the white can't say that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""-99""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"""I compared the number of balls to the gremlins hints and if the chances were higher than 50% ish I wouldn't get protection""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I would always take the hints from honest and be skeptical of non-honest""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I looked at the gremlins and then looked at their hint. depending on what gremlins I had, i looked at the combination of balls to see if I should risk it or not. If I had a lot of white balls and quite a few honest gremlins, I did not buy the protection plan""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,"""I am basically gambling so I would not pay attention to the Gremlins and look at the percentages """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,"""Just went with my gut guess. I didn't really use a strategy for any of them tbh""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"""there was no need to protect if the hint were made by all honest gremlins. also no need to protect if i had a combination of honest and black gremlin and the prediciton said it's white cos a black gremlin will never give a white answer""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""I had two honest gremlins, so the hint was 100% accurate.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"""I measured my decision based off of the type of gremlin giving the hint. If I felt that the gremlin or group was highly trustworthy, I would follow the advice. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
